Sd and Sdtty are two programs, often collectively called "Sd".&nbsp;
"Sd" itself uses a mouse and graphical user interface.&nbsp;  You
can select calls by clicking on them, or by typing them from the keyboard.&nbsp;
"Sdtty" uses a type-in interface only.&nbsp;  You select calls by typing their names.
Many callers prefer the type-in interface.  If you are one of them, you might want to
try "Sd" anyway.  It is keystroke-compatible with Sdtty, and has a more sophisticated
mechanism for displaying the setup.  That is, you can type calls exactly as you would
for Sdtty, and ignore the menu on the left side of the screen.
<p>
Both programs are available on PC's running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000,
Windows NT, Windows XP, or Windows 7.  It has been tested on 64-bit Windows 7.
Its status on Vista is unknown.  Only Sdtty is available on Linux, DOS or Windows 3.1.
We do not recommend using the program on DOS or Windows 3.1.  It does not work well,
and it has not been maintained beyond version 34.6.
<p>
You can be running Sd on your PC in minutes.&nbsp;
