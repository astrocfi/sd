<H1>Sd - Background</H1>
<P>
Sd and Sdtty are two programs, often collectively called "Sd".
"Sd" itself uses a mouse and graphical user interface.  You
select calls by clicking on them.  It is not yet available on
PC's.  "Sdtty" uses a type-in interface.  You select calls by
typing their names.  It is available on PC's and many workstations.
PC users may take comfort in the fact that most serious callers
prefer Sdtty.
<p>
Sd and Sdtty are not available for the Macintosh.
<p>
Because this is not a commercial program, and the name "Sd" is not trademarked,
it is not possible to prevent others from creating or distributing
other programs with the same name.  What you get here is the real thing.
<p>
You can be running Sd on your PC in minutes.
