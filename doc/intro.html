Sd and Sdtty are two programs, often collectively called "Sd".&nbsp;
"Sd" itself uses a mouse and graphical user interface.&nbsp;  You
can select calls by clicking on them, or by typing them from the keyboard.&nbsp;
"Sdtty" uses a type-in interface only.&nbsp;  You select calls by typing their names.
Many callers prefer the type-in interface.  If you are one of them, you might want to
try "Sd" anyway.  It is keystroke-compatible with Sdtty, and has a more sophisticated
mechanism for displaying the setup.  That is, you can type calls exactly as you would
for Sdtty, and ignore the menu on the left side of the screen.
<p>
Both programs are available on PC's running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000,
Windows NT, or Windows XP.&nbsp;  Only Sdtty is available on Linux, DOS or Windows 3.1.
We do not recommend using the program on DOS or Windows 3.1.  It does not work well,
and it is not being maintained beyond version 34.6.
<p>
You can be running Sd on your PC in minutes.&nbsp;

<p>
Sd and/or Sdtty are available on some other Unix systems.&nbsp;

<strong>YET ANOTHER COMPILER BUG ALERT!!!!!</strong>
<p>
Microsoft Visual C++, professional edition, version 5.0 also exhibits
the "snag bits and pieces" bug described below.  This means that there
are <strong>no</strong> Microsoft compilers that can correctly compile
Sd.  A temporary patch was put into the code to prevent it from
affecting users.  As of version 35, Sd is compiled with Gcc.  No version
of Gcc (including DJGPP), has ever been observed to generate incorrect code for Sd.
<p align="center">
<strong>ANOTHER COMPILER BUG ALERT!!!!!</strong>
<p>
In addition to the bug described below, Visual C++, version 5.0, service pack 3
has exhibited other inexcusable bugs, such as this:
<pre>
fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
compiler file E:\utc\src\\P2\main.c line 379
</pre>
This was reported to Microsoft on 12 Aug 2002.  No action was taken.
Any decent and professional company or organization takes reports
of internal compiler errors very seriously.
<p>
<p align="center">
<strong>COMPILER BUG ALERT!!!!!</strong>
<p>
Microsoft Visual C++, professional edition, version 6.0, service pack
5, has a bug that renders it unfit for compiling Sd or Sdtty.  See the
<a href="relnotes.html">release notes</a> for version 34.7 for
technical details of the bug.  (Briefly, the compiled program would
crash on a "snag bits and pieces".)  This bug does not affect users,
because this compiler has never been used, and never will be used, for
compiling the distributed version of Sd.

This bug was reported to Microsoft on 17 December 2001.
More than one year later, the following mail was sent to Microsoft management:

Subject: Extremely serious compiler bug in Visual C++ version 6.0, SP5

Friends:

On 17 December 2001 I reported a bug in the Visual C++ compiler.
The compiler silently generated incorrect code.  As you know,
that is, by far, the most serious mistake a compiler can make.

This bug involves the failure to restore the ECX register on exit
from a switch statement.

I received no reply.  I received no tracking number.  No service
pack beyond SP5 has appeared on your web site.

At the time I filed the report, I was unable to give a complete
test case, because it exceeded your size limit.
I gave information on contacting me (phone numbers, snailmail
address, email address) so that I could send the whole program
to you.  You have not contacted me.

You can see a summary of the details of the problem on my web site:
Up to <a href="http://www.lynette.org/sd/intro.html">http://www.lynette.org/sd/intro.html</a>
But, to reproduce this bug, you will most likely need the entire file.

More than a year has passed.  I wonder if you can tell me the status
of this bug?
