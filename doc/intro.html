Sd and Sdtty are two programs, often collectively called "Sd".&nbsp;
"Sd" itself uses a mouse and graphical user interface.&nbsp;  You
can select calls by clicking on them, or by typing them from the keyboard.&nbsp;
"Sdtty" uses a type-in interface only.&nbsp;  You select calls by typing their names.
Many callers prefer the type-in interface.  If you are one of them, you might want to
try "Sd" anyway.  It is keystroke-compatible with Sdtty, and has a more sophisticated
mechanism for displaying the setup.
<p>
Both programs are available on PC's running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000,
Windows NT, or Windows XP.&nbsp;  Only Sdtty is available on Linux, DOS or Windows 3.1.
We do not recommend using the program on DOS or Windows 3.1.  It does not work well,
and we may discontinue it.
<p>
You can be running Sd on your PC in minutes.&nbsp;
<a href="download-pc.html">Download Sd</a>.  (This includes Linux on Intel hardware.)
<p>
Sd and/or Sdtty are available on some other Unix systems.&nbsp;
<a href="download-unix.html">Download Sd for other varieties of Unix</a>.
<p>
Sd and Sdtty are not available for the Macintosh.
