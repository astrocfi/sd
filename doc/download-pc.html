<h1 align=center>Sd - Downloading for PC Compatibles</h1>
<p>
Only Sdtty is available for PC compatibles, not Sd.&nbsp;
(Note: <a href="intro.html">summary of availability</a>.)&nbsp;
It runs under DOS.&nbsp;
You can, of course, run it under Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows NT.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong><br>
There has been a change in file organization, in order to
permit people to download just the documentation formats
that they want.  The file "<code>INSTALL.EXE</code>" used to contain
the program, database, and documentation.  It now contains only
the program and database.  If you want the documentation, download
one of the other files.
<p>
You can download the file "<code>INSTALL.EXE</code>" from this Web page
onto your computer.&nbsp;
You can also download the documentation files shown below.
All of these files are the same as the files that you would get if you
obtained the program from us on a floppy disk.
The documentation files contain the same documents, packed into
convenient form, that you can browse or download from the
<a href="readings.html">Documentation</a> page.
<ol>
<li>
First, be sure that the folder into which you want to download the
file(s) exists.&nbsp;  This folder is typically "<code>C:\SD</code>".&nbsp;
If you haven't already created it, create it with these commands at the Command (MSDOS) Prompt:
<p>
<samp>
 &gt; C:<br>
 &gt; MD \SD<br>
 &gt; CD \SD
</samp>
<p>
<li>
Then download the file(s) from your Web browser into that folder.&nbsp;
The current version is 32.4, released on December 6, 1998.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong><br>
This version is significantly changed from previous versions.
It uses different libraries for its interface with the Windows
operating system.  This gives much more flexibility (see the
<a href="relnotes.html">release notes</a>
and the <a href="manual/">manual</a>),
but there may be problems with this version.
In case of difficulty, you can download
the previous version (32.0)
<a href="http://www.gildea.com/ftp/sd/oinstall.exe">here</a>.
<p>
If you are running Windows 3.1 or DOS, you must download a different
file.  Choose the correct one from the list below.
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="http://www.gildea.com/ftp/sd/install.exe">install.exe</a>
which has Sdtty for PC compatibles running Windows 95, 98, or NT.
<li>Download <a href="http://www.gildea.com/ftp/sd/installw.exe">installw.exe</a>
which has Sdtty for PC compatibles running DOS or Windows 3.1
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="http://www.gildea.com/ftp/sd/textdoc.exe">textdoc.exe</a>
which has all 4 documents in plain text form.
<li>Download <a href="http://www.gildea.com/ftp/sd/psdoc.exe">psdoc.exe</a>
which has all 4 documents in postscript form.
<li>Download <a href="http://www.gildea.com/ftp/sd/pdfdoc.exe">pdfdoc.exe</a>
which has all 4 documents in Acrobat form.
</ul>
<hr>
<li>
After downloading, you should have a file named <code>INSTALL.EXE</code>
or <code>INSTALLW.EXE</code>
(and whatever documentation files you downloaded) in the folder in
which you want Sdtty installed.&nbsp;
Do the actual installation by typing this at the Command Prompt:
<p>
<pre>
 &gt; install        (or installw)
</pre>
<p>
This command will unpack and install the program and database
into that folder.
<p>
Doing any or all of these:
<p>
<pre>
 &gt; textdoc
 &gt; psdoc
 &gt; pdfdoc
</pre>
<p>
will unpack the requested documentation files.
<p>
<li>
You may now delete the <code>.EXE</code> files or move them to a
floppy as a backup.
<p>
<li>
If you are installing Sd for the first time,
you will probably want to perform
a simple operation to make it possible to start the program by
clicking an icon.&nbsp;
Instructions for doing this operation are described in the
<a href="manual/">manual</a>.
If you have Windows 95, 98, or NT 4.0 or later, all you need to do is
(still at the Command Prompt) type one of
<p>
<pre>
 &gt; do_desk             (to put the icon on your Desktop),       or
 &gt; do_start            (to put the icon in the Start Menu),     or
 &gt; do_prog             (to put the icon in the Programs Menu)
</pre>
<p>
<li>
If you are upgrading from a previous version,
<a href="relnotes.html">read the Release Notes</a>.
</ol>
<p>
You can also order a diskette and nicely printed documentation from the
authors.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong><br>
Versions 31.72 and later behave differently from previous versions,
in a way that can cause frustration.&nbsp;  Please read the
<a href="relnotes.html">release notes</a>.
