<h1 align=center>Sd - Downloading for PC Compatibles</h1>
<p>
Only Sdtty is available for PC compatibles, not Sd.&nbsp;
(Note: <a href="intro.html">summary of availability</a>.)&nbsp;
It runs under DOS.&nbsp;
You can, of course, run it under Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows NT.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong><br>
There has been a change in file organization, in order to
permit people to download just the documentation formats
that they want.  The file "<code>INSTALL.EXE</code>" used to contain
the program, database, and documentation.  It now contains only
the program and database.  If you want the documentation, download
one of the other files.
<p>
You can download the file "<code>INSTALL.EXE</code>" from this Web page
onto your computer.&nbsp;
You can also download the documentation files shown below.
All of these files are the same as the files that you would get if you
obtained the program from us on a floppy disk.
The documentation files contain the same documents, packed into
convenient form, that you can browse or download from the
<a href="readings.html">Documentation</a> page.
<ol>
<li>
First, be sure that the directory into which you want to download the
file(s) exists.&nbsp;  This directory is typically "<code>C:\SD</code>".&nbsp;
If you haven't already created it, create it with these DOS commands:
<p>
<samp>
 &gt; C:<br>
 &gt; MD \SD<br>
 &gt; CD \SD
</samp>
<p>
<li>
Then download the file(s) from your Web browser.&nbsp;
The current version is 32.0b, released on September 7, 1998.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gildea.com/ftp/sd/install.exe">Download Sdtty
for PC compatibles.</a>
<li><a href="http://www.gildea.com/ftp/sd/textdoc.exe">Download all 4
documents in plain text form.</a>
<li><a href="http://www.gildea.com/ftp/sd/psdoc.exe">Download all 4
documents in postscript form.</a>
<li><a href="http://www.gildea.com/ftp/sd/pdfdoc.exe">Download all 4
documents in Acrobat form.</a>
</ul>
After downloading, you should have a file named <code>INSTALL.EXE</code>
(and whatever documentation files you downloaded) in the directory in
which you want Sdtty installed.&nbsp;
Do the actual installation by typing this at the DOS prompt:
<p>
<samp>
 &gt; INSTALL
</samp>
<p>
This command will unpack and install the program and database
into that directory.
<p>
Doing any or all of these:
<p>
<samp>
 &gt; TEXTDOC<br>
 &gt; PSDOC<br>
 &gt; PDFDOC
</samp>
<p>
will unpack the requested documentation files.
<p>
<li>
You may now delete the <code>.EXE</code> files or move them to a
floppy as a backup.
<p>
<li>
If you are installing Sd for the first time
and have Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows NT,
you will probably want to perform
a simple operation to make it possible to start the program by
clicking an icon.&nbsp;
Instructions for doing this operation are described in the
<a href="manual/">manual</a>.
<p>
If you are upgrading from a previous version,
<a href="relnotes.html">read the Release Notes</a>.
</ol>
<p>
You can also order a diskette and nicely printed documentation from the
authors.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong><br>
Versions 31.72 and later behave differently from previous versions,
in a way that can cause frustration.&nbsp;  Please read the
<a href="relnotes.html">release notes</a>.
