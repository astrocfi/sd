<h1 align=center>Sd - Downloading for PC Compatibles</h1>
<p>
Both Sd and Sdtty are available for PC compatibles running Windows.&nbsp;
(Note: <a href="intro.html">summary of availability</a>.)&nbsp;
They run under Windows 3.1, 95, 98, ME, 2000, NT, XP, Vista, 7, 10, 11, or DOS.  They may run under Windows 8.
<p>
Sdtty (but not Sd) is available, in source form, for other systems with 64-bit hardware.
<p>
For Windows, you can download the file "<code>install.exe</code>" from this web page
onto your computer.  It contains both Sd and Sdtty, and a copy of the
manual and release notes.
You can also download the documentation files shown below.
The documentation files contain the same documents, packed into
convenient form, that you can browse or download from the
<a href="readings.html">Documentation</a> page.
<ol>
<li>
Download the file(s) from your Web browser.&nbsp;
<p>
<strong>WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING:</strong><br>
The new installation procedure for Sd and Sdtty on Windows is much more
user-friendly than before, but it always installs into the folder
"<code>C:\Sd</code>".
(Software that can install to other folders and still make
correct shortcut icons costs $250.)  If you have a different calling
program in that directory (e.g. SRC Sd), the installation program will
offer to save that program elsewhere.
Users wishing to have both Sd/Sdtty and SRC Sd installed
on their Windows computer will need to ensure that SRC Sd is in some folder other
than "<code>C:\Sd</code>".  I do not know how serious or widespread
this problem will be.  If this creates difficulties for you, please
let me (wba@alum.mit.edu) know.  Do not download this program if you want
to keep SRC Sd and you do not understand this issue or its workaround.
<p>
The program is no longer actively maintained for Windows 3.1 or DOS.
If you must download install3.exe below, you will get version 34.7.
<p>
<strong>There have been a number of recent false positives from anti-virus software, due to that software getting increasingly picky.  You may need to disable anti-virus software when downloading.  All versions of install.exe are scanned for viruses before release, and the computer on which Sd is developed is scanned frequently.</strong>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Modern Windows: download <a href="install.exe">install.exe</a>
which has Sd and Sdtty for PC compatibles running Windows.
<p>
After downloading, you should have a file named <code>install.exe</code>.
Do the actual installation by launching that file.
On Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, or XP, launching <code>install.exe</code> will
unpack and install the program and database into the folder C:\sd.
It will overwrite the previous program, but will not affect other files,
such as written sequences or your <code>sd.ini</code> file.
<p>
An explorer will appear, containing useful shortcuts.  You can copy
any or all of them to the Desktop and/or Start Menu.  Use the right mouse button
for the copy, and click on "Copy Here" when asked.
<p>
<li>Not-Quite-So-Modern Windows:  Nearly all modern computers should be able to handle the 64-bit program.
If yours doesn't, do the above, but download <a href="install32.exe">install32.exe</a>
which has Sd and Sdtty version 39.29 for 32-bit Windows.
<p>
<li>Linux: download <a href="linux.tgz">linux.tgz</a> into your chosen directory.  It is typically ~/sd, that is,
a created sd directory subordinate to your home directory.  But it can be anywhere.
<p>
After downloading, you should have a file named <code>linux.tgz</code>,which
is a gzipped Unix archive.
Unpack it (that is, <code>tar -zxvf linux.tgz</code>) into the chosen directory.
It will create the "sdtty" executable, along with the calls database.
It will overwrite the previous program, but will not affect other files,
such as written sequences or your <code>sd.ini</code> file.  If this program
does not work for you, download the source files and compile.
<p>
<li>Windows 3.1 or DOS: download <a href="install3.exe">install3.exe</a>
which has Sdtty version 34.7 for PC compatibles running Windows 3.1 or DOS.
<p>
You probably don't want this.  Only extremely old computers (prior to 2002) will need it.
<p>
After downloading, you should have a file named <code>install3.exe</code>.
Do the actual installation by launching that file.  It will
unpack and install the program and database into the current folder.
We recommend doing this in folder C:\sd.
</ul>
<hr>
You can also download the documentation files in "bulk" form to your computer.
<p>
Use these for Windows or DOS:
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="textdoc.zip">textdoc.zip</a>
which has all documentation in plain text form.
<li>Download <a href="psdoc.zip">psdoc.zip</a>
which has all documentation in postscript form.
<li>Download <a href="pdfdoc.zip">pdfdoc.zip</a>
which has all documentation in Acrobat form.
</ul>
<hr>
Use these for Linux or other varieties of Unix:
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="textdoc.tar.gz">textdoc.tar.gz</a>
which has all of the above documents in plain text form.
<li>Download <a href="psdoc.tar.gz">psdoc.tar.gz</a>
which has all of the above documents in postscript form.
<li>Download <a href="pdfdoc.tar.gz">pdfdoc.tar.gz</a>
which has all of the above documents in Acrobat form.
</ul>
<hr>
<li>
Launching any or all of these:
<pre>
 &gt; textdoc
 &gt; psdoc
 &gt; pdfdoc
</pre>
<p>
will unpack the requested documentation files.
<p>
<li>
You may now delete the <code>.exe</code> or <code>.tgz</code> files or save them for backup purposes.

<li>
If you are upgrading from a previous version,
