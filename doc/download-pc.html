<h1 align=center>Sd - Downloading for PC Compatibles</h1>
<p>
Both Sd and Sdtty are available for PC compatibles.&nbsp;
(Note: <a href="intro.html">summary of availability</a>.)&nbsp;
They run under Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000,
Windows NT, Windows XP, Linux, Windows 3.1, or DOS.
If you are running Linux, Windows 3.1 or DOS, only Sdtty is available .
<p>
You can download the file "<code>INSTALL.EXE</code>" from this Web page
onto your computer.  It contains both Sd and Sdtty, and a copy of the manual.&nbsp;
You can also download the documentation files shown below.
All of these files are the same as the files that you would get if you
obtained the program from us on a floppy disk.
The documentation files contain the same documents, packed into
convenient form, that you can browse or download from the
<a href="readings.html">Documentation</a> page.
<ol>
<li>
Download the file(s) from your Web browser into that folder.&nbsp;
<p>
<strong>WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING:</strong><br>
The new installation procedure for Sd and Sdtty is much more
user-friendly than before, but it always installs into the folder
"<code>C:\Sd</code>".
(Software that can install to other folders and still make
correct shortcut icons costs $250.)  If you have a different calling
program in that directory (e.g. SRC Sd), the installation program will
offer to save that program elsewhere.
Users wishing to have both Sd/Sdtty and SRC Sd installed
on their computer will need to ensure that SRC Sd is in some folder other
than "<code>C:\Sd</code>".  I do not know how serious or widespread
this problem will be.  If this creates difficulties for you, please
let me (wba@alum.mit.edu) know.  Do not download this program if you want
to keep SRC Sd and you do not understand this issue or its workaround.
<p>
If you are running Linux, Windows 3.1, or DOS, you must download a different
file.  Choose the correct one from the list below.
<p>
It is becoming increasingly diffcult to maintain the program for Windows 3.1 or DOS,
because the compiler that is used (DJGPP version 2.81) is not being maintained
and is not keeping up with technology changes.  This program does not work well,
and may be discontinued in the future.

<ul>
<li>Download <a href="install.exe">install.exe</a>
which has Sd and Sdtty for PC compatibles running Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, NT, or XP.
<li>Download <a href="install3.exe">install3.exe</a>
which has Sdtty for PC compatibles running DOS or Windows 3.1.
<li>Download <a href="linux.tar.gz">linux.tar.gz</a>
which has Sdtty for PC compatibles running Linux.
</ul>
<hr>
You can also download the documentation files in "bulk" form to your computer.
<p>
Use these for Windows or DOS:
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="textdoc.zip">textdoc.zip</a>
which has all documentation in plain text form.
<li>Download <a href="psdoc.zip">psdoc.zip</a>
which has all documentation in postscript form.
<li>Download <a href="pdfdoc.zip">pdfdoc.zip</a>
which has all documentation in Acrobat form.
</ul>
<hr>
Use these for Linux or other varieties of Unix:
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="textdoc.tar.gz">textdoc.tar.gz</a>
which has all of the above documents in plain text form.
<li>Download <a href="psdoc.tar.gz">psdoc.tar.gz</a>
which has all of the above documents in postscript form.
<li>Download <a href="pdfdoc.tar.gz">pdfdoc.tar.gz</a>
which has all of the above documents in Acrobat form.
</ul>
<hr>
<li>
After downloading, you should have a file named <code>INSTALL.EXE</code>
or <code>INSTALL3.EXE</code>
(and whatever documentation files you downloaded).
Do the actual installation by launching that file.
On Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, or XP, launching <code>INSTALL.EXE</code> will
unpack and install the program and database into the folder C:\sd.
On Windows 3.1 or DOS, launching <code>INSTALL3.EXE</code> will
unpack and install the program and database into the current folder.
We recommend doing this in folder C:\sd.
<p>
On Linux, the file <code>linux.tar.gz</code> is a gzipped Unix archive.
Unpack it into the chosen directory.  It will create the "sd" directory
subordinate to that directory, and place the files in same.
<p>
<li>
A Windows explorer will appear, containing useful shortcuts.  You can copy
any or all of them to the Desktop and/or Start Menu.  Use the right mouse button
for the copy, and click on "Copy Here" when asked.
<p>
<li>
Launching any or all of these:
<pre>
 &gt; textdoc
 &gt; psdoc
 &gt; pdfdoc
</pre>
<p>
will unpack the requested documentation files.
<p>
<li>
You may now delete the <code>.EXE</code> files or save them for backup purposes.
<p>
<li>
If you are upgrading from a previous version,
<a href="relnotes.html">read the Release Notes</a>.
</ol>
<p>
You can also order a diskette and nicely printed documentation from the
authors.
