<h1 align=center>Sd - Downloading for PC Compatibles</h1>
<p>
Only Sdtty is available for PC compatibles, not Sd.&nbsp;
(Note: <a href="intro.html">summary of availability</a>.)&nbsp;
It runs under DOS.&nbsp;
You can, of course, run it under Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows NT.
<p>
You can download the file "<code>INSTALL.EXE</code>" from this Web page
onto your computer.&nbsp;
That file is the same as the file that you would get if you obtained the
program from us on a floppy disk.
<ol>
<li>
First, be sure that the directory into which you want to download the
file exists.&nbsp;  This directory is typically "<code>C:\SD</code>".&nbsp;
If you haven't already
created it, create it with these DOS commands:
<p>
<samp>
 &gt; C:<br>
 &gt; MD \SD<br>
 &gt; CD \SD
</samp>
<p>
<li>
Then download the file from your Web browser.&nbsp;
The current version is 31.93, released on February 7, 1998.
<p>
 - <a href="http://www.gildea.com/ftp/sd/install.exe">Download Sdtty
for PC compatibles.</a>
<p>
<li>
After downloading, you should have a file named <code>INSTALL.EXE</code>
in the directory in which you want Sdtty installed.&nbsp;
Do the actual installation by typing this at the DOS prompt:
<p>
<samp>
 &gt; INSTALL
</samp>
<p>
This command will unpack and install the program, database, and all
of the documentation files into that directory.
<p>
<li>
You may now delete the file <code>INSTALL.EXE</code> or move it to a
floppy as a backup.
<p>
<li>
If you
are installing Sd for the first time
and have Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows NT,
you probably want to perform
a simple operation to make it possible to start the program by
clicking an icon.&nbsp;
Instructions for doing this operation are described in the
<a href="manual/">manual</a>.
<p>
If you are upgrading from a previous version,
<a href="relnotes.html">read the Release Notes</a>.
</ol>
<p>
You can also order a diskette and nicely printed documentation from the
authors.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong><br>
Versions 31.72 and later behave differently from previous versions,
in a way that can cause frustration.&nbsp;  Please read the
<a href="relnotes.html">release notes</a>.
