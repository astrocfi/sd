<h1 align=center>Sd - Downloading for PC Compatibles</h1>
<p>
Both Sd and Sdtty are available for PC compatibles running Microsoft Windows.&nbsp;
(Note: <a href="intro.html">summary of availability</a>.)&nbsp;
They are believed to run under DOS, or Windows 3.1, NT4.0, 95, 98, ME,
2000, NT, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, 11.
<p>
Sdtty (but not Sd) is available, in source form, for other systems with 64-bit hardware.
<p>
Sd and Sdtty are compiled for 64-bit systems.  We believe that all
modern computers can handle this.  Version 39.29, the last one for
32-bit systems, will continue to be made available; see below.
<p>
The program is no longer maintained for Windows 3.1 or DOS.  You can get the
(very old) version 34.7 for those systems.  See below.
If you must download install3.exe below, you will get version 34.7.
<p>
For Windows, you can download the file "<code>install.exe</code>" from this web page
onto your computer.  It contains both Sd and Sdtty, and a copy of the
manual and release notes.
You can also download the documentation files shown below.
The documentation files contain the same documents, packed into
convenient form, that you can browse or download from the
<a href="readings.html">Documentation</a> page.
<ol>
<p>
Download the file(s) from your Web browser.&nbsp;
<p>
<strong>Downloading things from the internet can be dangerous, and a lot of software is in place to protect you.
The Sd installation program, that you will download below, is a "self-extracting archive".  Such things are particularly
dangerous, because they disgorge executables from inside themselves onto your computer.  So it may seem that your
anti-virus mechanisms are going out of their way to make the installation difficult.  This is as it must be.
<p>
There are three pieces of software in place to protect your computer from viruses:
<p>
<li>The browser itself (actually, an anti-virus package that has been installed with it) may try to stop you from downloading "install.exe".
You may get a popup saying something like "Take me back to safety" or "I understand the risks, take me there anyway."  Choose the latter.
<li>Your operating system (actually, whatever anti-virus package you may be using) may find the creation of the new "install.exe" suspicious,
and may warn you, or, depending on how aggressive it is, simply delete it.  You may need to temporarily disable that check.  For BitDefender,
that could consist of starting the antivirus package, clicking on "protection", and "antivirus", and "open".  Then choose "advanced",
"bitdefender shield", and click it off for a few minutes.
<li>
Once "install.exe" is safely on your computer and you have launched it, your operating system may recognize that it could be dangerous
because it changes the software on your computer.  It may ask permission to run it, giving options "More info" and "Don't run".  Click on "More info".  A "Run anyway" button should appear.  Click it.
<p>
Your mileage may vary, of course.
<p>
All versions of install.exe are scanned for viruses before release, and the computer on which Sd is developed is scanned frequently.</strong>

<ul>
<li>Modern Windows: download <a href="install.exe">install.exe</a>
which has Sd and Sdtty for PC compatibles running Windows.
<p>
After downloading, you should have a file named <code>install.exe</code>.
Do the actual installation by launching that file.  (Or perhaps the system will do that for you.)
It will ask you for the location in which to place the program.  Unless
you are doing something extremely unusual, type ``C:\sd''.
That's the location where it has traditionally been stored.
It will overwrite the previous program, but will not affect other files,
such as written sequences or your <code>sd.ini</code> file.
<p>
<li>Old Windows:  Nearly all modern computers should be able to handle the 64-bit program.
If yours doesn't, download <a href="install32.exe">install32.exe</a>,
which has Sd and Sdtty version 39.29 for 32-bit Windows, and follow directions.
<p>
<li>Windows 3.1 or DOS: download <a href="install3.exe">install3.exe</a>
which has Sdtty version 34.7 for PC compatibles running Windows 3.1 or DOS.
You probably don't want this.  Only extremely old computers (prior to 2002) will need it.
<p>
<li>Linux: download <a href="linux.tgz">linux.tgz</a> into your chosen directory.  It is typically ~/sd, that is,
a created sd directory subordinate to your home directory.  But it can be anywhere.
<p>
After downloading, you should have a file named <code>linux.tgz</code>,which
is a gzipped Unix archive.
Unpack it (that is, <code>tar -zxvf linux.tgz</code>) into the chosen directory.
It will create the "sdtty" executable, along with the calls database.
It will overwrite the previous program, but will not affect other files,
such as written sequences or your <code>sd.ini</code> file.  If this program
does not work for you, download the source files and compile.
