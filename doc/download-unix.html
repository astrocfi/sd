<h1 align=center>Sd - Downloading for Unix Workstations</h1>
<p>
You can download Sd or Sdtty for a number of Unix workstations.
These are compressed archives of the programs and documentation.
The Unix "<code>tar</code>" command is used for archiving, and
"<code>gzip</code>" is used for compression.
<p>
NOTE:  It has been brought to my attention that shared libraries
do not work properly on Linux.  Specifically, a compilation on
Debian 3.0 wouldn't run on Red Hat 6.2.  Therefore, Sdtty uses
statically linked libraries on all varieties of Unix, including Linux.
<p>
In general, these program archive files, when unpacked, will create
the "sd" directory subordinate to the directory in which the
unpacking takes place, and then place the files in same.
<ul>
<li>Linux: download <a href="linux.tgz">linux.tgz</a> into your chosen directory.  It is typically ~/sd, that is,
a created sd directory subordinate to your home directory.  But it can be anywhere.
<p>
After downloading, you should have a file named <code>linux.tgz</code>,which
is a gzipped Unix archive.
Unpack it (that is, <code>tar -zxvf linux.tgz</code>) into the chosen directory.
It will create the "sdtty" executable, along with the calls database.
It will overwrite the previous program, but will not affect other files,
such as written sequences or your <code>sd.ini</code> file.  If this program
does not work for you, download the source files and compile.
<li>For other varieties of Unix, download the sources from <a href="sd_source.zip">sd_source.zip</a> and compile.
</ul>
<hr>
You can download the zipped documentation here.  These are the
same files that are presented on the documentation page.
These documentation archives do not create a subordinate directory.
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="textdoc.tar.gz">textdoc.tar.gz</a> containing all documents in plain text form.
<li>Download <a href="psdoc.tar.gz">psdoc.tar.gz</a> containing all documents in postscript form.
<li>Download <a href="pdfdoc.tar.gz">pdfdoc.tar.gz</a> containing all documents in Acrobat form.
</ul>
