<h1 align=center>Sd - Downloading for Unix Workstations</h1>
<p>
You can download Sd or Sdtty for a number of 64-bit operating systems.
<p>
NOTE:  It has been brought to my attention that shared libraries
do not work properly on Linux.  Specifically, a compilation on
Debian 3.0 wouldn't run on Red Hat 6.2.  Sdtty's source files don't deal with any of this.
<ul>
<li>Linux: download <a href="linux.tgz">linux.tgz</a> into your chosen directory.  It is typically ~/sd, that is,
a created sd directory subordinate to your home directory.  But it can be anywhere.
<p>
After downloading, you should have a file named <code>linux.tgz</code>,which
is a gzipped Unix archive.
Unpack it (that is, <code>tar -zxvf linux.tgz</code>) into the chosen directory.
It will create the "sdtty" executable, along with the calls database.
It will overwrite the previous program, but will not affect other files,
such as written sequences or your <code>sd.ini</code> file.  If this program
does not work for you, download the source files and compile.
<li>For other varieties of Unix, download the sources from <a href="sd_source.zip">sd_source.zip</a> and compile.
</ul>
