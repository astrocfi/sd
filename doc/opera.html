<p>
<b>Microsoft agreed to pay Norway's Opera Software $12.75 million to
head off a threatened lawsuit over code that made some Web pages on MSN
look bad in certain versions of Opera's Web browser, CNET News.com has
learned.</b>
 </p><p> Opera disclosed the payment last week in a terse
press release that omitted other details, including the name of the
settling party and the nature of the dispute. </p><p> But a source indicated that the payment came from Microsoft
in order to close the books on a clash over obscure interoperability
problems. On at least three separate occasions, Opera has accused
Microsoft of <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-1008869.html?tag=nl" title="Opera claims MSN is still off-key -- Thursday, May 22, 2003">deliberately breaking interoperability</a> between its MSN Web portal and various versions of the Opera browser--charges that the software giant has repeatedly denied.
 </p>
   <p>
 A Microsoft representative said the company does not comment on rumors.
 </p><p>
Reached by phone, Opera executives refused to name the company involved
in the settlement or describe the nature of the legal claims, citing a
confidentiality agreement. </p><p> "We forwarded a few facts to a big international corporation
and settled before we took legal action," Opera Chief Technology
Officer <a target="_blank" href="http://dw.com.com/redir?destUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FPeople%2Fhowcome&amp;siteId=22&amp;oId=2100-3513-5218163&amp;ontId=3513&amp;lop=nl.ex">Hakon Lie</a> said Tuesday. "This resolves an issue very close to my heart."
 </p><p>
The deal marks the latest in a string of settlements from Microsoft,
which is seeking to simplify its business by clearing up potentially
damaging legal claims. In the past year, the company has agreed to pay
billions of dollars to wrap up <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5183848.html?tag=nl" title="Sun settles with Microsoft, announces layoffs -- Friday, Apr 2, 2004">litigation with Sun Microsystems</a>, <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5189980.html?tag=nl" title="Microsoft, InterTrust iron out lawsuit -- Monday, Apr 12, 2004">digital rights management developer InterTrust</a> and <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-1011296.html?tag=nl" title="Microsoft to pay AOL $750 million -- Thursday, May 29, 2003">Time Warner's Netscape Communications division</a>, among others.
 </p><p>
While the Opera payment is relatively tiny, it underscores ongoing
ripple effects in the browser market that stem from the overwhelming
dominance of Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Having used its desktop
operating system monopoly to help trounce its primary rival Netscape,
Microsoft has <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5088642.html?tag=nl" title="Developers gripe about IE standards inaction -- Thursday, Oct 9, 2003">effectively abandoned significant browser development efforts</a>.
That's left companies with negligible market share such as Opera and
Netscape's Mozilla open-source project to lead innovation in the field.
</p><p> For example, IE 6, the latest version of Microsoft's Web
browser, released in August 2001, does not yet offer a tool that
automatically blocks Web pop-up advertising. Microsoft has <news:link id="5105139">promised pop-up blocking</news:link>
as part of a Windows XP upgrade due out later this summer known as SP2.
That puts it well behind Opera and others that have offered pop-up
blocking for months in response to overwhelming consumer demand. </p><p>
 Last year, a member of Microsoft's IE team indicated that the company planned to <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-1011859.html?tag=nl" title="Microsoft to drop standalone IE -- Monday, Jun 2, 2003">drop independent development</a>
of the browser altogether, opting instead to fold its functions into
the next major overhaul of its Windows operating system, a project
code-named Longhorn. </p><p>
 Since then, however, Microsoft has remained largely silent about its long-range browser development plans.
 </p><p>
"I'm not sure what their plan is, whether they'll do some upgrades with
SP2, wait for Longhorn or break out a separate release," Directions on
Microsoft analyst <a target="_blank" href="http://dw.com.com/redir?destUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.directionsonmicrosoft.com%2Fpress%2Fmattrosoffbio.html&amp;siteId=22&amp;oId=2100-3513-5218163&amp;ontId=3513&amp;lop=nl.ex">Matt Rosoff</a>
said. "Whatever they do, IE is not a major strategic technology for
Microsoft anymore...They don't have a huge team working on IE, and
there hasn't been a lot of evolution in IE for a couple years." </p><p>
 <b>Web authors bow to IE</b><br> IE's dominance has also
created fallout for Web standards, because Microsoft delivers the Web
to roughly nine out of every 10 people who use it. </p><p>
  Although IE 6 provides <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-277029.html?tag=nl" title="Standards advocates go into hibernation -- Thursday, Dec 13, 2001">good standards support</a>,
some Web site developers have decided that it's easier to create sites
that work best with versions of IE, rather than use code that works
equally well on all standards-compliant browsers. For example,
Shutterfly, the online photo store backed by Netscape co-founder Jim
Clark, does not support any version of Opera or Mozilla browsers,
according to a <a target="_blank" href="http://dw.com.com/redir?destUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterfly.com%2Ferror%2Fbrowser.jsp%3Ffrom%3D%252Faccount%252Finit.jsp&amp;siteId=22&amp;oId=2100-3513-5218163&amp;ontId=3513&amp;lop=nl.ex">warning</a> displayed on the site this week.
 
 </p><p>
The problem has been a top issue for Web standards advocates for some
time, shifting the focus of standards compliance away from browser
makers and toward <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-269804.html?tag=nl" title="New front opens in Web standards war -- Wednesday, Jul 11, 2001">companies behind popular Web authoring tools</a>, such as Macromedia and Adobe Systems.
 
 </p><p>
Opera's past complaints with Microsoft included charges that the
software giant deliberately sought to undermine the experience of Web
surfers using its browser by delivering a different set of instructions
to Opera than those sent to IE for rendering Web pages on MSN. The
results included misaligned margins and indentations that cut off some
words, among other things. </p><p> Microsoft in 2003 admitted that it had taken steps to detect
different types of browsers accessing MSN and sent different Web page
layouts to different products. But the company said its efforts were
aimed at promoting standards compliance rather than at hurting products
that compete with its dominant Internet Explorer browser. Microsoft
said it has since stopped the practice. </p><p> "MSN is committed to providing the best experience we can to
all of its consumers, and there is no intent to degrade the consumer
experience for any visitors to MSN," a Microsoft representative wrote
in an e-mail. "When this issue hit last year, MSN tested Opera's latest
browser, determined and made adjustments to ensure all Opera 7 users
had a quality experience while visiting MSN." </p><p>
 Opera, by contrast, has long contended that Microsoft's alleged maneuvers were intentional and hurt its reputation.
 </p><p>
MSN's browser lockouts at the time provided incendiary ammunition for
Microsoft critics, including anti-Microsoft industry group <a target="_blank" href="http://dw.com.com/redir?destUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.procompetition.org&amp;siteId=22&amp;oId=2100-3513-5218163&amp;ontId=3513&amp;lop=nl.ex">ProComp</a>,
which in 2001 accused Microsoft of unfairly exploiting its massive lead
in the browser market to muscle out smaller competitors. </p><p>
 "Who else could it be but Microsoft?" ProComp President Mike Pettit said this week, referring to the payment.
 </p><p>
Pettit cast a jaundiced eye at the transaction, along with other
settlements Microsoft has made with rivals that have alleged
wrongdoing. </p><p> "If you really analyze the harm that is inflicted and
measure the damages paid, it's a very small dollar amount to
Microsoft," Pettit said. "It's just the cost of doing business to them,
so they're just going to keep doing it over and over. They pay 5 or 10
cents on the dollar in damages way after the fact, and the net effect
of it is to further unbalance the playing field. In the final analysis,
they got away with it." </p><p> These days, Opera is looking to move past the PC to
distribute its Web browser on devices such as cell phones and personal
digital assistants. As a result, Opera will in the future face less of
a threat from Microsoft, Opera director John Patrick said. </p><p> "People wonder why anyone would get into the browser
business," he said. "But this isn't about Microsoft and the PC. It's
about every other kind of device, from set-top boxes to cell phones. IE
doesn't dominate that. It's a different market...The opportunities are
enormous." <br clear="all">
